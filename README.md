Project “Clock”. An adapter must be implemented in the project, which makes it possible to use a clock with arrows in the same way as a digital clock.
In the class “ClockWithArrows” the turns of the hands are stored.
To run the application you need set ClockConsole as Startup Project. Default value for digital clock is 00:00:00 (if you do not set the analog clock arrows rotation angles or set arrow rotation value that does not satisfy the condition).
When entering values that will not satisfy the condition, no changes will be made.
Launched ClockConsole project.
