Project “Clock”. An adapter must be implemented in the project, which makes it possible to use a clock with arrows in the same way as a digital clock.
In the class “ClockWithArrows” the turns of the hands are stored. If you do not specify the rotation angles of the arrows, the default values will be 0.
When entering values that will not satisfy the condition, no changes will be made.
Launched ClockConsole project.
